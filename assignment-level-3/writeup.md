                 Getting more about HTML/CSS
				 
Now we are getting deep into these web languages. HTML & CSS are
easy languages to start with but with time they get little bit 
complex. CSS is really something which just looks easy but really
vast and gets tough with time. HTML is really easy but we need to
handle this with care, because it holds a very important position
in SEOs. HTML document should be as semantic as possible.
                        Starting with HTML, it has got many tags
such as main, section, article, header, footer etc. These tags are 
must for our HTML doc. as it helps our browser to read things pro-
perly.
                         Coming to CSS, there are many default beh-
aviour the browsers which creates, sometimes, really uncertain thi-
ngs on the webpage. So, to avoid these uncertainities, we need to
use CSS resets and then we should design our webpage.

Thank You.
